"""Check that every file naming this project's version names the same one.

A release bump touches a dozen files across six ecosystems, and the ones that
go stale are never the ones anyone is looking at: a benchmarks pom two releases
behind, a lockfile's second version record that `npm version` does not rewrite,
an install snippet a reader copies verbatim. None of them break a build. They
just publish a number that is not true.

Two design choices, both learned the hard way:

*Derived, not listed.* A hand-written table of touchpoints is only as good as
the last person who remembered to extend it, and the file that ships stale is
always the one nobody added. Every candidate path that exists here is checked.

*Parsed, not grepped.* A regex for `<version>` in a pom matches every plugin's
version, and one for `"version"` in a lockfile matches every dependency. Those
belong to other people. Where the format has structure -- JSON, XML -- this
reads the structure and looks only at the fields that are ours.

    python scripts/check_version_sync.py

Exits non-zero on the first disagreement, naming the file and both versions.
