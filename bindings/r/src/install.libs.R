# Install the compiled package shared object plus the bundled C ABI library so
# the package is self-contained: on Windows the wickra_zk_abi.dll (matched by the
# *.dll glob, loaded via PATH in .onLoad); on Linux the libwickra_zk.so (matched by
# the *.so SHLIB_EXT glob); on macOS the libwickra_zk.dylib (added explicitly, since
# R package objects use the .so extension there too). The Unix rpath baked by
# configure ($ORIGIN / @loader_path) resolves it from this libs directory.
