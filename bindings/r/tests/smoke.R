# Shipped with the package and run by `R CMD check`, so it must work inside the
# built tarball -- where no repository sits above it and no fixture file exists.
# It touches nothing but the package: load the library, take a handle, drive one
# command through the boundary, and read the version back.
#
# The cross-language golden parity test lives in run_tests.R, which is excluded
# from the tarball by .Rbuildignore and run from the repository by CI. That one
# needs golden/ above it; this one needs nothing.
