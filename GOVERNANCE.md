# Governance

`wickra-zk` is part of the Wickra project and follows the same lightweight
governance model.

## Roles

- **Maintainers** review and merge changes, cut releases and set direction. The
  current maintainers are listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).
- **Contributors** propose changes via pull requests. Anyone may contribute; see
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision making

Day-to-day changes are merged by a maintainer once CI is green and the change
has been reviewed. Larger or breaking changes (the `ScanSpec` / condition schema,
the JSON command boundary, or the public API) are discussed in an issue first and
decided by maintainer consensus; the lead maintainer breaks ties.

## Releases

Releases follow semantic versioning. Pre-1.0, the spec and report schemas may
change between minor versions. A release is tagged `vX.Y.Z` by a maintainer and
published to the language registries by CI.

## Changes to governance

This document is changed by a pull request approved by the maintainers.
